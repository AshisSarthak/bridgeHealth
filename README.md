# Assumptions and short coming

I have implemented this wiothout using redux due to time constraint. And though I know jst and enzyme I tried the new test-library which ate up a lot of time and i could not finish the unit tests.

Also I have not done a detailed debugging on the logic. I could have done that better.
I have tried to give a good look and feel but was not able to complete with in 3 hours.
Another thing I assumed was the border health percent of each device to be 10. Just to ensure have a good number of devices.

This solution is not complete as I thought it would be but with more time I could do better.
